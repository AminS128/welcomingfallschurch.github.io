    <h1 class="small">Awareness</h1>
    <p>Getting involved starts with becoming aware. Our big awareness event of the year is Welcoming Week, held each September. During Welcoming Week, over 300 towns, cities, and countries around the country host local events that bring together neighbors of all backgrounds. Welcoming Falls Church has been celebrating Welcoming Week each year since 2018. We are looking forward to revisiting Welcoming Week traditions such as our kickoff ice cream social in Mr. Brown’s Park, a booth at the Falls Church Fall Festival, and sponsorship of Sunset Cinema in Cherry Hill Park, and new activities as well. To learn more about Welcoming Week and to get involved, see <a href="/welcoming-week">here</a>.</p>
    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p>Getting involved starts with becoming aware. Welcoming Falls Church is a learning community, and we invite you to check out these resources:</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_ngozi_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story">The Danger of a Single Story</a>. This TED Talk given by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie – with over 19 million views – highlights the ways that we all benefit from a variety of perspectives of life, society, and community. Continue on with Ms. Adichie's <a href="https://www.onemorepagebooks.com/search/site/americanah">Americanah</a> – for [a] knockout of a novel about immigration, American dreams, the power of first love, and the shifting meanings of skin color. . . . A marvel. (NPR)</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.onemorepagebooks.com/book/9780812998481">Behold the Dreamers</a>. Considered by many to be one of the top narratives of the contemporary immigrant experience – an Oprah pick, PEN/Faulkner award-winner, NY Times/Washington Post best book of the year, etc. This was our first recommended book in 2018! FCCPS Superintendent Peter Noonan made the book one of his recommended summer reads in June 2019, and we brought Imbolo Mbue to Falls Church in September 2019. She spoke powerfully about Immigration and the American Dream as well as her personal experiences living in Falls Church. Enjoy a podcast review of the book from our podcasting media partner <a href="https://www.threewaypc.com">Three Way</a> by creator Erin Keating <a href="https://www.threewaypc.com/episodes/2019/9/10/quickie-featuring-behold-the-dreamers-by-imbolo-mbue">here</a>.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.alangratz.com/writing/refugee/">Refugee</a>. This award-winning book by Alan Gratz follows three children at three different points in time, all connected by the same goal: escape. Refugee is appropriate for children 8 years and up and provides an unflinching look at the lengths some young people must go through to find safety. Mr. Gratz joined our students by videoconference to speak on October 28, 2020 in honor of National Immigrants Day.</p>
    <p>Becoming aware is a great start. We hope you will consider how to take <a href="/get-involved/action">action</a>.</p>
