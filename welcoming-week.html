    <h1>Welcoming Week</h1>
    <h2>Welcoming Week 2021</h2>
    <p>We had a great Welcoming Week last year! We kicked off Celebrating Community: Our Stories | A Film Series sponsoring a showing of Raya and the Last Dragon at Falls Church’s Cherry Hill Park, hosted a webinar with the producer and chief cultural advisor of Raya and the Last Dragon that celebrated Falls Church’s Southeast Asian community and in partnership with Eden Center, and - we hope - took another small step towards building a community of neighbors.</p>

    <p><strong>GET INVOLVED</strong>. Join our Welcoming Week Steering Committee. This group is a great way to get to know some like-minded people and our organization, and to help bring people together for some fun activities at the beginning of the school year.</p>
    <p>Welcoming Week Steering Committee meetings over the summer are flexible (we know people are in and out of town). You can manage your commitment to helping with one event–or more. And we appreciate whatever you bring to the effort. There are specific roles for people with communications, event planning, and finance backgrounds, but we appreciate all volunteers from age eight to 80 (and beyond!) and can look forward together to a great Welcoming Week 2022!</p>
    <p>For more information and to get involved, <a href="mailto:welcomingfallschurch@gmail.com">email us</a> and we’ll let you know the dates of upcoming Welcoming Week Steering Committee meetings.</p>
    <p>We are also grateful to the City of Falls Church City Council for its <a href="files/2021-welcoming-week-resolution.pdf">resolution</a> again recognizing Welcoming Week in Falls Church! We look forward to celebrating Welcoming Week again this year. Join us for community activities of all sorts, as we together encourage Falls Church to build a community of neighbors.</p>
