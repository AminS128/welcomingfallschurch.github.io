    <h1>National Welcoming Week | September 12–21, 2025</h1>
    <p>Once again, we enjoyed celebrating Welcoming Week 2025, as part of the larger Welcoming America movement. We are grateful for the community’s support for these great activities:</p>
    <p class="descriptor">City of Falls Church City Council Meeting | Monday, Sept. 8</p>

    <p class="descriptor">Falls Church Fall Festival | Saturday, Sept. 13</p>
    <p class="description">Welcoming Falls Church welcomed the community to visit our booth at the Fall Festival on the grounds of the Falls Church Community Center, 223 Little Falls Street, Falls Church. This was our eighth Fall Festival—and we love how Welcoming Week coincides with the Fall Festival each year!</p>
    <p class="descriptor">Harvey's Yacht Club Fundraiser | Saturday, Sept. 20</p>
    <p class="description">We wound up Welcoming Week with an event at Harvey's, which donates 10% of their annual Yacht Club fundraiser to Welcoming Falls Church! We love the atmosphere at Harvey’s and are so grateful for their support. Likewise, thanks to Clare and Don's, which hosted an after-party.</p>
