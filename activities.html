    <p>What can we do to welcome immigrants and refugees to our community? Our agenda is to learn, serve, and live together better, for the good of us all.</p>
    <p><strong>Learn.</strong> Explore the contemporary immigrant experience by joining a book club to discuss <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Behold-Dreamers-Oprahs-Book-Club/dp/0525509712/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539031722&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=behold+the+dreamers"><em>Behold the Dreamers</em></a>, a PEN/Faulkner award-winning first novel by Imbolo Mbue. Learn about the experience (in Falls Church!) that inspired Mbue to write <em>Behold the Dreamers</em>, in the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2017/06/26/oprah-picks-debut-novel-behold-the-dreamers-for-book-club/103197042/">USA Today review of the book</a>. Join a Welcoming Falls Church book club discussion—sign up to join us on <a href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/70a0f4cabae22a2fd0-book1">Thursday, January 3</a>—or make it your own personal or book club pick and <a href="mailto:welcomingfallschurch@gmail.com">let us know</span> you're doing so!</a></p>
    <p><strong>Serve.</strong> Join us to serve neighbors in need. To be clear, not all immigrants are in need, and immigrants make up a large proportion of the nation's most successful entrepreneurs. Immigrants make up a large proportion of the nation's most successful entrepreneurs. But some—particularly those that are more newly-arrived and face language and cultural gaps—are in particular need. Sign up <a href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/70a0f4cabae22a2fd0-volunteer">here</a> to serve our neighbors in one of our monthly visits to the Spend Yourself Food Pantry in Seven Corners, on Saturdays, November 24, December 29, January 26, or the last Saturday of each month thereafter. We also invite you to join support 1st and 2nd graders in the community through the Readers Are Leaders program, which is offered by Comunidad, a new and locally-rooted nonprofit serving the Seven Corners and Culmore communities. Volunteer Tuesday and/or Thursday from 5:00-6:00 p.m. to help children improve their reading skills. For more information please <a href="mailto:maralee.gc@gmail.com">email Comunidad's Founder and Executive Director</a> or call Comunidad at <a href="tel:7034748195">703.474.8195</a>. This may also be a great activity for a responsible middle or high school student with a heart for service—ask Maralee for more information.</p>
    <p><strong>Live.</strong> Finally, we encourage you to make welcoming immigrants and refugees part of your lifestyle. One way to do this is through the simple act of hospitality. Share a meal with a neighbor that crosses cultures in ways that you might not otherwise experience. Also, consider getting involved in our initiative to organize international-themed potluck dinners that bring together area families. <a href="mailto:welcomingfallschurch@gmail.com">Contact Program Coordinator Katie Adams</a> to learn more about "International Night in the Home," which extends the experience of the very successful International Nights in area schools to homes in the community. You can even follow up on this very locally, in your own neighborhood. Celebrate and enrich the cultural fabric of your own life, by sharing the gift of hospitality and a meal with international neighbors.</p>
    <p>We hope you join us in Welcoming Falls Church. Sign up for one or more activities, and if you have not already done so provide us your information in the form below, so that we can be in touch with you proactively about future activities. We look forward to engaging with area residents, civic and business leaders, our schools and many others, to build a community of neighbors.</p>
