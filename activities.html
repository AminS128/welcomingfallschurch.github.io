    <h1>Activities</h1>
    <p>What can we do to welcome immigrants and refugees to our community? Our agenda is to learn, serve, and live together better, for the good of us all.</p>
    <p><strong>Learn.</strong> Explore the contemporary immigrant experience by joining a book club to discuss <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Behold-Dreamers-Oprahs-Book-Club/dp/0525509712/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539031722&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=behold+the+dreamers"><em>Behold the Dreamers</em></a>, a PEN/Faulkner award-winning first novel by Imbolo Mbue. Learn about the experience (in Falls Church!) that inspired Mbue to write <em>Behold the Dreamers</em>, in the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2017/06/26/oprah-picks-debut-novel-behold-the-dreamers-for-book-club/103197042/">USA Today review of the book</a>. Join a <a href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/70A0F4CABAE22A2FD0-book1">Welcoming Falls Church book club discussion</a> or make it your own personal or book club pick and <a href="mailto:welcomingfallschurch@gmail.com">let us know</span> you're doing so!</a> We even hope to bring Imbolo Mbue to Falls Church to help us kick off “Welcoming Week” this fall, on Saturday, September 14, the day of the Falls Church Festival. Learn more about our plans for Welcoming Week and our hope to welcome Imbolo Mbue to Falls Church <a href="welcoming-week">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Also, join us for an opportunity to learn more about immigration in the U.S. The Pew Research Center, which does fantastic survey research on a host of issues, has designed an "email course" about U.S. immigration that you can learn more about <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/10/16/want-to-understand-u-s-immigration-weve-got-an-email-course-for-you/">here</a>. This class is free and is available any time, anywhere.</p>
    <p>Please let us know if you are interested in potentially joining a discussion group to talk about the Pew course, that would meet this summer.</p>
    <p><strong>Serve.</strong> Join us to serve neighbors in need. To be clear, not all immigrants are in need, and immigrants make up a large proportion of the nation's most successful entrepreneurs. But some—particularly those that are more newly-arrived and face language and cultural gaps—are in particular need. Sign up <a href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/70a0f4cabae22a2fd0-volunteer">here</a> to serve our neighbors in one of our monthly visits to the Spend Yourself Food Pantry in Seven Corners, on the third Saturday of each month during 2019. Join us in a summer reading program at the Willston Multicultural Center in Falls Church once, twice, or three times a week! Volunteer and help elementary age children improve their reading skills. Strong Readers Strong Leaders, a program led by Welcoming Falls Church partner Comunidad, a newly-founded, local nonprofit, serves to bolster literacy skills among elementary age students. Dates are June 24th-August 16th, Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday from 3:30pm-5:00pm. Make it a memorable summer and join us as we build Strong Readers Strong Leaders. Email Maralee Gutierrez, the founder of Comunidad, at maralee@comunidadva.org or call 703.474.8195. Teens age 15 and up also enjoy the opportunity to serve as a volunteer camp counselor at the Willston Multicultural Center, in the RecQuest summer camp. This camp hosts approximately 75 children grades K-6. This is a flexible volunteer opportunity, requiring a minimum one-week commitment, four to eight hours per day (the camp meets 9am-5pm) between June 17 and August 23. Email Elisa Velasco, the Director of the Willston Multicultural Center, at elisa.velasco@fairfaxcounty.gov, for more information.</p>
    <p><strong>Live.</strong> Finally, we encourage you to make welcoming immigrants and refugees part of your lifestyle. One way to do this is through the simple act of hospitality. Share a meal with a neighbor that crosses cultures in ways that you might not otherwise experience. Also, consider getting involved in our initiative to organize international-themed potluck dinners that bring together area families. You can even follow up on this very locally, in your own neighborhood. Celebrate and enrich the cultural fabric of your own life, by sharing the gift of hospitality and a meal with international neighbors.</p>
    <p>We hope you join us in Welcoming Falls Church. Sign up for one or more activities, and if you have not already done so provide us your information in the form below, so that we can be in touch with you proactively about future activities. We look forward to engaging with area residents, civic and business leaders, our schools and many others, to build a community of neighbors.</p>
