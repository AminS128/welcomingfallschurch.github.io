    <h1>Partners</h1>
    <p>Welcoming Falls Church celebrates the efforts of many like-minded people in the community to welcome immigrants and refugees. Local government authorities; community and civic organizations; churches, synagogues, and mosques; and perhaps most importantly individuals and families who befriend neighbors, acquaintances, classmates, are engaging international residents of our community and making welcoming work.</p>
    <p>We are fortunate to live in a community where most residents profess positive sentiments towards immigrants and refugees. The Greater Falls Church area is remarkably diverse, and becoming more so, offering us all everyday opportunities for us to connect with the world, close to home.</p>
    <p>But we can always do more. International residents of the area feel more uncertainty socially, politically, and economically, than in the past. So we invite you to act, to connect relationally, and to cross cultural boundaries in new ways. In addition, we're connecting institutionally in the community as well and are delighted to have entered into partnerships with the Falls Church City Public Schools and the Falls Church Education Foundation. We thank your FCCPS and FCEdF colleagues and look forward to collaborating with others as well.</p>
    <p>Welcoming Falls Church does not seek to supplant the work of other organizations. We hope to celebrate the work of others, draw attention and resources to these issues, and mobilize our community to make hospitality, opportunity, and welcoming work. We ask organizations committed to the good work of welcoming our immigrant and refugee neighbors to contact us.</p>
