    <p><strong>About Welcoming Falls Church</strong></p>
    <p>Welcoming Falls Church is building a community of neighbors. Our goals are hospitality toward immigrants and refugees and opportunity for us all. We believe that by engaging locally we can overcome divisions and reinforce some of our society's greatest strengths. Inspired by a national movement called <a href="/about/welcoming-america">Welcoming America</a>, we are grassroots, nonpartisan, and public-private in character. We invite you to learn more and to join us.</p>
    <p><strong>About Welcoming Week</strong></p>
