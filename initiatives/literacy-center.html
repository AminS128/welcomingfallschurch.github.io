    <p>We invite you to learn more about literacy and what we do. Responses to some frequently asked questions are below.</p>
    <h3>How does Welcoming Falls Church's Adult & Family Literacy Center help immigrants and refugees?</h3>
    <p>Welcoming Falls Church's goal is to create a community of neighbors where all members feel welcome and included. Our Adult &amp; Family Literacy Center is focused on helping immigrants and refugees gain the literacy and language skills they need to thrive in our community.  As part of our curriculum, we also invite community leaders to speak about local programs and initiatives. This year, we are also introducing a Children's Literacy Activities Program (CLAP!) to children, ages four to 10, of adults taking English language and literacy classes. Parents must register their child in advance. <a href="mailto:WFCLiteracy@gmail.com">Email us</a> with questions or to register.</p>
