    <p>We invite you to learn more about literacy and what we do. Responses to some frequently asked questions are below.</p>
    <h3>How does Welcoming Falls Church's Adult & Family Literacy Center help immigrants and refugees?</h3>
    <p>Welcoming Falls Church's goal is to create a community of neighbors where all members feel welcome and included. Our Adult &amp; Family Literacy Center is focused on helping immigrants and refugees gain the literacy and language skills they need to thrive in our community. As part of our curriculum, we also invite community leaders to speak about local programs and initiatives. This year, we also introduced a Children's Literacy Activities Program (CLAP!) to children, ages four to 12, of adults taking English language and literacy classes. We are particularly thankful to the high school students who have already made this program a success. Email us with questions or to register your child for CLAP!</p>

    <h3>How can I register for classes?</h3>

    <h3>Is childcare provided for children of adult English learners?</h3>
    <p>Yes! This fall we began offering childcare to children ages four to 10 years old whose parents are taking English language and literacy classes. This spring we are expanding the age range to ages 4-12. This new initiative, the Children's Literacy Activities Program (CLAP!), focuses on teaching children pre-literacy and literacy skills to help them be successful in school--and have fun at the same time! Our high school volunteers have made this program a big success! Please help us keep this program running by purchasing items on our <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2HTQJ7P9S0QUR">Amazon Wishlist</a>. Spaces are limited, so <a href="mailto:WFCLiteracy@gmail.com">email us</a> for more information or to register your child.</p>
