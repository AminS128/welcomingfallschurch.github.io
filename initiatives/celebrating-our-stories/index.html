    <h1>Celebrating our Stories Series</h1>
    <p>Welcoming Falls Church is building a community of neighbors. Our goals are hospitality toward immigrants and refugees and opportunity for us all. We believe that by engaging locally we can overcome divisions and reinforce some of our society's greatest strengths. We believe that the best way to connect to one another is through our stories. The Celebrate Our Stories Series aims to challenge and expand existing perceptions towards immigrants and refugees in our city, reducing bias and stereotypes and fostering a welcoming and inclusive community for everyone.</p>
    <p>Explore the various community members that make up our diverse city below!! Simply click on their photograph to read more about why they chose Falls Church as their home, how their lives have unraveled here, and essentially what Falls Church means to them!</p>
