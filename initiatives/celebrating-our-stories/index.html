    <h1>Celebrating our Stories Series</h1>
    <p>Welcoming Falls Church is building a community of neighbors. Our goals are hospitality toward immigrants and refugees and opportunity for us all. We believe that by engaging locally we can overcome divisions and reinforce some of our society's greatest strengths.</p>
    <p>We believe that the best way to connect to one another is through our stories. The Celebrate Our Stories Series aims to challenge and expand existing perceptions towards immigrants and refugees in Falls Church, reducing bias and stereotypes, and fostering a welcoming and inclusive community for everyone.</p>
    <p>We invite you to meet some of the friends of Welcoming Falls Church that make up our diverse community, below. Simply click on their photograph to read more about why they chose Falls Church as their home, how their lives have played out here, and what Falls Church means to them!</p>
