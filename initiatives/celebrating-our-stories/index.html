    <h1>Celebrating our Stories Series</h1>
    <p>Welcoming Falls Church is building a community of neighbors. Our goals are hospitality toward immigrants and refugees and opportunity for us all. We believe that by engaging locally we can overcome divisions and reinforce some of our society's greatest strengths. We believe that the best way to connect to one another is through our stories. The Celebrate Our Stories Series aims to challenge and expand existing perceptions towards immigrants and refugees in our city, reducing bias and stereotypes and fostering a welcoming and inclusive community for everyone.</p>
