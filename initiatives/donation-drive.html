        <p>Welcoming Falls Church will welcome several refugee families to Falls Church in the coming year. We need your help to furnish an apartment for the first family that we'll welcome. Check out <a href="http://bit.ly/3DcHYot">this spreadsheet</a> to see our needs and pledge specific items, or you can <a href="mailto:welcomingrefugeesgroup1@gmail.com">email our first Support Team directly</a>Â to volunteer items.</p>
    </div>
    <p>We are so grateful for the response of the community to our Donation Drive effort to collect household goods and furniture, and also the volunteers' responses - including that of a neighbor who has offered their garage for a full year, a friend who is lending a pickup truck, and the Scouts and leaders of Boy Scout Troop 349, whose Scouts are joining us to collect donated items on October 8.</p>
    <p>Please watch this space - and we'll let you know in our newsletter, if you're signed up there - for information about future Donation Drives. We appreciate the community coming together to support newly-arrived refugee families and will follow up on this for other families too.</p>
    <p>Thank you for helping us welcome families to Falls Church!</p>
