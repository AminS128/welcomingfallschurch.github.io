        <p>Welcoming Falls Church will welcome several refugee families to Falls Church in the coming year. We need your help to furnish an apartment for the first family that we'll welcome. Check out <a href="http://bit.ly/3DcHYot">this spreadsheet</a> to see our needs and pledge specific items, or you can <a href="mailto:welcomingrefugeesgroup1@gmail.com">email our first Support Team directly</a>Â to volunteer items.</p>
    </div>
    <p>We will contact you in the next three weeks to arrange drop off or pickup.</p>
    <p>Thank you for helping us welcome families to Falls Church!</p>
