        <p>Welcoming Falls Church will welcome at least five refugee families to Falls Church in the coming year–and hopefully more. We have already completed a donation drive for the first family we will welcome, but we need your help to furnish the apartment for the second family that we'll welcome. Check out Support Team Two’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VpfXJTRUrd2Vi1knnTUEni3eXaP1UQV6Z2FzryDgVCw/edit?usp=sharing">donations needed list</a> to see our needs and pledge specific items, or you can <a href="mailto:kevinhurst@me.com">email Kevin Hurst</a>, the leader of Support Team Two, directly to volunteer items.</p>

    <p>We are so grateful for the response of the community to our Donation Drive effort to collect household goods and furniture, and also the volunteers' responses - including that of a neighbor who has offered their garage for a full year, the friend who lent a pickup truck, and the Scouts and leaders of Boy Scout Troop 349, whose Scouts joined us to collect donated items for Support Team One’s donation drive.</p>
    <p>Please watch this space - and we'll let you know in our newsletter, if you're signed up there - for information about future Donation Drives. We appreciate the community coming together to support newly-arrived refugee families and will follow up on this for other families too.</p>
    <p>Thank you for helping us welcome families to Falls Church!</p>
