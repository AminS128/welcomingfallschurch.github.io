    <h1>Welcoming Refugees</h1>
    <p>Many in Falls Church support the resettlement of refugees in the area. Falls Church's Eden Center shows that we can successfully welcome refugees. Many Southeast Asian refugees settled in the area the 1970s and 1980s. That wave of resettlement eventually led to Eden Center becoming the center for Vietnamese culture and commerce on the East Coast. This is <a href="https://littlesaigonclarendon.com/the-history">fascinating local history</a>, worth exploring, and inspiring for those that would like to see the community welcome more refugees.</p>
