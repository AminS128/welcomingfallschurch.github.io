    <h1>Welcoming Refugees</h1>
    <p>Many in Falls Church support the resettlement of refugees in the area. Falls Church's Eden Center shows that we can successfully welcome refugees. Many Southeast Asian refugees settled in the area the 1970s and 1980s. That wave of resettlement eventually led to Eden Center becoming the center for Vietnamese culture and commerce on the East Coast. This is <a href="https://littlesaigonclarendon.com/the-history">fascinating local history</a>, worth exploring, and inspiring for those that would like to see the community welcome more refugees.</p>

        <p>Falls Church is responding to the call to welcome refugees! Help us welcome five refugee families to the City of Falls Church in the next year.</p>

    <p><strong>Falls Church Welcoming Refugees Fund</strong>. Welcoming Falls Church is grateful for the City of Falls Church’s support of our <a href="/initiatives/renting-to-refugees">Renting to Refugees</a> initiative. The City is supporting this initiative by allocating $50,000 to create a Falls Church Welcoming Refugees Fund. The Fund will pay part of the rent for these families for 12-18 months, to make rent more affordable and support their resettlement in the community.</p>
    <p><strong>GET INVOLVED</strong>. In addition to partial rent support, we are organizing to welcome these families well. Please consider the following:</p>
