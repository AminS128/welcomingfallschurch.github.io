    <h1>Welcoming Refugees</h1>
    <p>Many in Falls Church support the resettlement of refugees in the area. Falls Church's Eden Center shows that we can successfully welcome refugees. Many Southeast Asian refugees settled in the area the 1970s and 1980s. That wave of resettlement eventually led to Eden Center becoming the center for Vietnamese culture and commerce on the East Coast. This is <a href="https://littlesaigonclarendon.com/the-history">fascinating local history</a>, worth exploring, and inspiring for those that would like to see the community welcome more refugees.</p>

        <p>Falls Church is responding to the call to welcome refugees! We are welcoming five refugee families to the City of Falls Church with rent assistance through our <a href="/initiatives/renting-to-refugees">Renting to Refugees</a> initiative, and more across Greater Falls Church with English language training, job search/mentorship support, and connections with the local schools. See below for how to get involved, and to help us become a community that welcomes refugees well.</p>

    <p><strong>Falls Church Welcoming Refugees Fund</strong>. This is an innovative, public-private effort to make housing more affordable for refugees. Welcoming Falls Church is grateful for the City of Falls Church’s support of our <a href="/initiatives/renting-to-refugees">Renting to Refugees</a> initiative. The City is supporting this initiative by allocating $50,000 to create a Falls Church Welcoming Refugees Fund. The Fund will pay part of the rent for these families for 12-18 months, to make rent more affordable and support their resettlement in the community.</p>

    <p>Our priorities at the moment are 1) to continue to form Support Teams that will engage directly with families and help us welcome them well to the community, 2) a Donation Drive that will help our third Support Team furnish an apartment, and 3) develop our <a href="/initiatives/welcoming-landlord-network">Welcoming Landlord Network</a> to permit us to welcome more families. Learn more about Support Teams <a href="/initiatives/support-teams">here</a> as one way to get involved and about our community-wide Donation Drive <a href="/initiatives/donation-drive">here</a>.</p>
