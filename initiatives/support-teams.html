    <h1>Support Teams</h1>
    <img src="/images/support-team.jpg" alt="People in support team meeting" class="inline-main-img right">
    <p>Our Support Teams committed literally thousands of hours - approximately 4500 hours in total - to the five families we welcomed to Falls Church in 2022 and 2023. The selfless commitment of the volunteers who joined Support Teams testifies to the welcoming culture of Falls Church and its people.</p>
    <p>How did this work? In addition to partial rent support, we organized Support Teams to welcome refugee families well. Each team numbered eight to ten adults, who played defined roles supporting a family as they settled in the area.
    </p>
    <p>Over 110 people expressed interest at some point in joining a Support Team or otherwise lend volunteer support to the Welcoming Refugees effort; over 40 served on a Support Team at some point; each team saw three or four volunteers continue working with the family during their entire two years in the program; and everyone involved was touched by the experience, as we built a community of neighbors by making Falls Church more welcoming to refugees.
    </p>
    <p>
        We hope to be able to welcome refugees to Falls Church again, to learn from our experience in 2022-2025, and to build on this program. If we are again able to welcome refugees, are you interested in organizing or leading a team, working with friends, your church, temple, or mosque, or another organization, or in joining an established team? Please let us know by <a href="mailto:info@welcomingfallschurch.org">emailing us</a> and telling us about your interest.
