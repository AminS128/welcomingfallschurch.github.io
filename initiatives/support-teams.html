    <h1>Support Teams</h1>
    <img src="/images/support-team.jpg" alt="People in support team meeting" class="inline-main-img right">
    <p>In addition to partial rent support, we are organizing to welcome refugee families well. We are forming Support Teams - each with five adults, who complete adult and child protection, cultural, and trauma awareness training - and who play defined roles supporting a family as they settle in the area.</p>
    <p>Over 50 people have stepped forward to join a Support Team or otherwise lend volunteer support to the Welcoming Refugees effort so far, as we build a community of neighbors by making Falls Church more welcoming to refugees.</p>
    <p>Are you interested in organizing or leading a team, working with friends, your church, temple, or mosque, or another organization, or in joining an established team? Please let us know by filling out <a href="https://forms.gle/k1sacddLa8byCzMy7">this form</a>! Please note: filling out our Support Team Interest Form does not obligate you to any specific volunteer role. We will be in touch with you to confirm how and when you’d get involved. (Thank you for filling out the form – it will enable us to form teams well.)</p>
