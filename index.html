<h2>Welcoming Falls Church</h2>
<p>Welcoming Falls Church is building a community of neighbors. Our goals are hospitality toward immigrants and refugees and opportunity for us all. We believe that by engaging locally we can overcome divisions and reinforce some of our society’s greatest strengths. Inspired by a national movement called Welcoming America, we are grassroots, apolitical, and public-private in character. We invite you to learn more and to join us.</p>
<p>Context. Falls Church's history bears testimony to the struggles of African-Americans to attain their rights and freedoms, from Jim Crow through the Civil Rights Movement to today. And Falls Church—especially Greater Falls Church—is becoming more and more diverse. Just as the United States is in the midst of a historical demographic transition, so, too, is Falls Church changing. The public schools of the City of Falls Church play host to families that speak a total of 48 languages in the home, and the national and cultural backgrounds represented in Greater Falls Church—with its population of almost 90,000—is even more diverse.</p>
<p>Vision. Making welcoming a social norm is the goal of the Welcoming America movement generally, and one worth pursuing locally. The residents of Falls Church and its elected representatives are responding to the challenge and opportunity of this growing diversity. The first sentence of the City of Falls Church's &quot;Falls Church 2040&quot; strategic plan states that &quot;Falls Church in 2040 will be a welcoming and inclusive community.&quot; The Falls Church City Council embraced the ideals of the Welcoming America movement by declaring the week of September 16, 2018 as “Welcoming Week,” and set a goal of becoming a “Welcoming City”—a strong statement of support for immigrants and refugees in our community. Now it's up to us, the residents of Falls Church, to nurture that vision as it comes to fruition.</p>

                                <h3>What</h3>
                                <p>Welcoming America is an Atlanta-based non-profit organization that encourages local initiatives to welcome immigrants and refugees to communities around the country. A growing number of communities recognize that being welcoming leads to prosperity for all. Launched in 2009, Welcoming America has spurred a fast-growing movement across the United States, with one in eight Americans living in a welcoming community. A non-partisan organization, Welcoming America is proud to support the many local governments and civic partners who lead efforts to make their communities more vibrant places for all.</p>

                                <h3>Why</h3>
                                <p>Welcoming America values hospitality, opportunity, diversity, equality, people, relationships, inclusion, and leadership, values that many in Falls Church share. Welcoming Falls Church&mdash;a group of citizens and organizations in Falls Church, Virginia&mdash;is bringing the Welcoming America movement to our community. This work is always important, now more than ever given the noisy political debates that sometimes distract us from our obligation to our neighbors. Together we can have a profound impact in our community, and make a welcoming spirit real.</>

                                <h3>Who</h3>
                                <p>Welcoming America's unique, local approach goes beyond a single program or service. Welcoming America encourages organizations across the community to work together, to reduce the barriers that immigrants face to fully engaging in society, and to build bridges between newcomers and long-time residents. Welcoming America’s social change model is unique in its holistic local focus&mdash;working with local partners&mdash;in Falls Church with public and private participants in Welcoming Falls Church&mdash;to encourage its residents to engage across race, language, and culture, in a manner that benefits everyone involved.</p>

<p>“Welcoming Week” is observed annually by communities that are part of the welcoming movement, and what a fantastic kick off we had to our first Welcoming Week!</p>
<p>First, the Falls Church City Council honored Welcoming Week with a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CityofFallsChurchGov/photos/a.289986851393/10155423616661394/?type=3&amp;theater"><span class="underline">proclamation</span></a> in support of Welcoming Falls Church. Working together, we can create an environment in which all individuals in the The Little City feel welcome.</p>
<p>Then, we participated in four awareness building events.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>At the Falls Church Fall Festival on Saturday, September 15, we met lots of new friends and neighbors who showed their support by enthusiastically holding up a heart sign (<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/CQ29FA6GWLTvkFUK8"><span class="underline">see photos</span></a>). Special thanks to Laura Chaves and Nayoung Lee, two designers who helped us launch Welcoming Falls Church. People asked us great questions about the Welcoming America movement, challenged us about making Falls Church more welcoming with affordable housing options and joined the movement by signing up to join our service days with Spend Yourself at Columbia Baptist Food Pantry and our book club to discuss <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/251547/behold-the-dreamers-oprahs-book-club-by-imbolo-mbue/9780525509714/"><span class="underline">Behold the Dreamers</span></a> by Imbolo Mbue, an Oprah Book Club novel about marriage, immigration, class and race through the story of a Cameroonian couple trying to make a new life in New York just at the onset of the Great Recession (see below if you’d like to sign up too). We are thankful to Katie Adams, Greg Anderson, Win Dayton, Linda Doornsbosch, Debbie Liang, and Mike Sakata for representing Welcoming Falls Church and helping with our booth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Falls Church Education Foundation welcomed us with open arms at their annual Race for the Schools Fundraiser on Sunday, September 16. Friends - new and old, including Thomas Jefferson - stopped by to show their support by holding up a Welcoming Falls Church sign (<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/CQ29FA6GWLTvkFUK8"><span class="underline">see more photos</span></a>!). Special thanks to Debbie Hiscott for her wholehearted support and allowing us to share our story with a table at the race and to Debbie Liang for representing the movement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Falls Church Elementary PTA welcomed us at their annual Ice Cream Social and Info Fair. Many parents came by our table and expressed interest in joining the movement with their families. We were able to share about a new idea, bridging cultural divides over dinner and dialogue - with native English speaking families, immigrant families, and bridge families who may have lived or traveled abroad or speak a foreign language. Special thanks to Katie Adams who is coordinating these dinners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Willston Multicultural Center invited us to join them for their Fall Festival on Saturday, September 22. It was a wonderful time of meeting neighbors in the broader Falls Church community. We hope to join them on Saturday, November 10 for a beautification day at the Willston Center. Special thanks to Linda Doornbosch for representing Welcoming Falls Church.</p>

            <h2>Activities</h2>
<p>What can we do to welcome immigrants and refugees to our community? Our agenda is to learn, serve, and live together better, for the good of us all.</p>
<p><strong>Learn.</strong> Explore the contemporary immigrant experience by joining a book club to discuss <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Behold-Dreamers-Oprahs-Book-Club/dp/0525509712/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539031722&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=behold+the+dreamers"><em>Behold the Dreamers</em></a>, a PEN/Faulkner award-winning first novel by Imbolo Mbue. Learn about the experience (in Falls Church!) that inspired Mbue to write <em>Behold the Dreamers</em>, in the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2017/06/26/oprah-picks-debut-novel-behold-the-dreamers-for-book-club/103197042/">USA Today review of the book</a>. Join a Welcoming Falls Church book club discussion—sign up for <a href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/70a0f4cabae22a2fd0-book">Tuesday, November 13</a> or <a href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/70a0f4cabae22a2fd0-book1">Thursday, January 3</a>—or make it your own personal or book club pick and <a href="mailto:welcomingfallschurch@gmail.com">let us know</span> you're doing so!</a></p>
<p><strong>Serve.</strong> Join us to serve neighbors in need. To be clear, <span class="underline">many</span> local small businesses are owned and operated by immigrants. Immigrants make up a large proportion of the nation’s most successful entrepreneurs. But some—particularly those that are more newly-arrived and face language and cultural gaps—are in particular need. Sign up <a href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/70a0f4cabae22a2fd0-volunteer">here</a> to serve our neighbors in one of our monthly visits to the Spend Yourself Food Pantry in Seven Corners, on Saturdays, October 27, November 24, or December 29. We will also make a special effort to engage with neighbors through Fairfax County’s Willston Multi-Cultural Center as we help to beautify their soccer field on Saturday, November 10. Sign up <a href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/70a0f4cabae22a2fd0-volunteer1">here</a> and get to know the Willston community.</p>
<p><strong>Live.</strong> Finally, we encourage you to make welcoming immigrants and refugees part of your lifestyle. One way to do this is through the simple act of hospitality. Share a meal with a neighbor that crosses cultures in ways that you might not otherwise experience. Also, consider getting involved in our initiative to organize international-themed potluck dinners that bring together area families. <a href="mailto:welcomingfallschurch@gmail.com">Contact us</a> to learn more about “International Night in the Home,” which extends the experience of the very successful International Nights in area schools to homes in the community. You can even follow up on this very locally, in your own neighborhood. Celebrate and enrich the cultural fabric of your own life, by sharing the gift of hospitality and a meal with international neighbors.</p>
<p>We hope you join us in Welcoming Falls Church. Sign up for one or more activities, and if you have not already done so provide us your information in the form below, so that we can be in touch with you proactively about future activities. We look forward to engaging with area residents, civic and business leaders, our schools and many others, to build a community of neighbors.</p>

                    <h2>About Falls Church</h2>
                    <p>Falls Church, Virginia, is a suburb of Washington, D.C., densely populated, but with a small-town feel.</p>
                    <p>Falls Church's history bears testimony to the increasing diversity of the United States. The history of Falls Church is intertwined with the struggles of African-Americans to attain their rights and freedoms, from the period of Jim Crow through the Civil Rights Movement. But Falls Church&mdash;especially Greater Falls Church&mdash;is becoming more and more diverse. Just as the United States is in the midst of a historical demographic transition, so too is Falls Church changing&mdash;and much more rapidly than many parts of the country.</p>
                    <p>The public schools of the City of Falls Church play host to families that speak over 48 languages in the home, and the number of national and cultural backgrounds represented in Greater Falls Church is far larger.</p>
                    <p>The residents of the area and its elected representatives are responding to this challenge: the first sentence of the City of Falls Church's "Falls Church 2040" strategic plan states that "Falls Church in 2040 will be a welcoming and inclusive community." The City Council has embraced the ideals of the Welcoming America movement and declared the week of September 16, 2018 as Welcoming Week&mdash;a statement of support for immigrants and refugees in our community. Now it's up to us, the residents of Falls Church, to make sure that vision comes to fruition.</p>
                    <p>Please join Welcoming Falls Church, as we engage with civic and business leaders, our schools and many others, to build a community of neighbors.</p>

                    <h2>Partners</h2>
                    <p>Welcoming Falls Church celebrates the efforts of many like-minded people in the community to welcome immigrants and refugees. Local government authorities; community and civic organizations; churches, synagogues, and mosques; and perhaps most importantly individuals and families who befriend neighbors, acquaintances, classmates, are engaging international residents of our community and making welcoming work.</p>
                    <p>We are fortunate to live in a community where most residents profess positive sentiments towards immigrants and refugees. The Greater Falls Church area is remarkably diverse, and becoming more so, offering us all everyday opportunities for us to connect with the world, close to home.</p>
                    <p>But we can always do more. International residents of the area feel more uncertainty socially, politically, and economically, than in the past. So we invite you to act, to connect relationally, and to cross cultural boundaries in new ways. In addition, we're connecting institutionally in the community as well and are delighted to have entered into partnerships with the Falls Church City Public Schools and the Falls Church Education Foundation. We thank your FCCPS and FCEdF colleagues and look forward to collaborating with others as well.</p>
                    <p>Welcoming Falls Church does not seek to supplant the work of other organizations. We hope to celebrate the work of others, draw attention and resources to these issues, and mobilize our community to make hospitality, opportunity, and welcoming work. We ask organizations committed to the good work of welcoming our immigrant and refugee neighbors to contact us.</p>
