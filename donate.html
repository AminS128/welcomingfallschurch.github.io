    <p><strong>Fall 2022: “Shaping a More Livable World Challenge” Fundraiser | Thursday, Sept 15</strong>. Welcoming Falls Church is partnering with DAI Global, an international development consulting firm headquartered in Bethesda, for a fundraiser event as part of Welcoming Week. This year, DAI is prioritizing the support of Afghan refugees in their transition to life in the U.S. as part of its annual fundraising campaign. Falls Church resident Bikram Ghosh - a member of the DAI team - is organizing an event benefiting Welcoming Falls Church as part of this DAI program. The event will feature a guest speaker, former Afghan government official Najibullah Wardak, as well as a cooking class. Watch for more information about how to participate and <a href="mailto:welcomingfallschurch@gmail.com">email us</a> if you’d like to be a part of this event.</p>
    <p><strong>Welcoming Week 2019.</strong> Welcoming Falls Church has historically operated with a very modest budget, but we were humbled by the community’s willingness to support our work when we asked for help to bring Behold the Dreamers author Imbolo Mbue to Falls Church for Welcoming Week 2019.</p>
