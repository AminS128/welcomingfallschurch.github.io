    <p>Welcoming Falls Church Inc. is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization operating with Tax ID 88-2015871.</p>
    <p>Please consider helping us set the foundation for all of our programming. We are looking for major donors, as well as friends who would support us on a monthly basis whether $25, $50 or $100 a month. Donate <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=BHV8XLCPHAANS">here</a>.</p>
    <p>In 2023, we’re pursuing three major areas of programming.</p>
    <p><a href="/initiatives/welcoming-refugees">Renting to Refugees</a></p>
    <p>Building upon our efforts to help refugee families resettle in Falls Church by providing English language training, job search/mentorship support, and connections to local schools in greater Falls Church, Welcoming Falls Church established a Welcoming Refugees Fund. This Fund is an innovative public-private effort, in conjunction with the City of Falls Church, to provide rental assistance for refugee families resettling in the City of Falls Church, making rent more affordable and easing their transition to life in the United States.</p>
    <p><a href="/initiatives/literacy-center">Adult and Family Literacy Center</a></p>
    <p>Launched in spring 2022, the Adult &amp; Family Literacy Center is focused on helping immigrants and refugees gain the literacy and language skills they need to thrive in our community. Children of adult learners can participate in the Children's Literacy Activities Program (CLAP!). Classes are held two nights a week during the fall and spring at Oak Street Elementary School, with the support of Falls Church City Public Schools.</p>
    <p><a href="/welcoming-week">Community Building Activities</a></p>
    <p>Committed to creating a community of neighbors who are welcoming of immigrants and refugees, Welcoming Falls Church hosts annual events like our Welcoming Week Ice Cream Social and Thanksgiving dinners for recently arrived immigrants and resettled refugees. Intended to raise awareness and foster relationships within our community, these events are free for community members.</p>
    <p>Checks can be made out to Welcoming Falls Church and mailed to Emily Draper, Treasurer, Welcoming Falls Church, 122 West Greenway Boulevard, Falls Church, VA 22046; or donate online <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=BHV8XLCPHAANS">here</a>.</p>

    <p>We are seeking 50 friends to provide ongoing support, whether $25, $50 or $100 a month. Would you consider becoming one of our 20 donors to give $50 a month or 5 donors to give $100 a month?</p>
    <p>Thank you!</p>
