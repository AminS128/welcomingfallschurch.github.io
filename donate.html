    <p>Launched in spring 2022, the Adult &amp; Family Literacy Center is focused on helping immigrants and refugees gain the literacy and language skills they need to thrive in our community. Children of adult learners can participate in the Children's Literacy Activities Program (CLAP!). Classes are held two nights a week during the fall and spring at Oak Street Elementary School, with the support of Falls Church City Public Schools.</p>

    <p>Committed to creating a community of neighbors who are welcoming of immigrants and refugees, Welcoming Falls Church hosts annual events like our Welcoming Week Ice Cream Social and Thanksgiving dinners for recently arrived immigrants and resettled refugees. Intended to raise awareness and foster relationships within our community, these events are free for community members.</p>
