    <p>*NEW* Welcoming Falls Church is now an independent non-profit organization! (Since its formation, Welcoming Falls Church operated as a program of a 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsor.)</p>
    <p>Please consider helping us set the foundation for all of our programming. We are looking for major donors, as well as friends who would support us on a monthly basis whether $25, $50 or $100 a month. Donate <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=BHV8XLCPHAANS">here</a>.</p>
    <p>In 2023, we’re pursuing three major areas of programming.</p>
    <p><a href="/initiatives/welcoming-refugees">Renting to Refugees</a></p>
    <p>Building upon our efforts to help refugee families resettle in Falls Church by providing English language training, job search/mentorship support, and connections to local schools in greater Falls Church, Welcoming Falls Church established a Welcoming Refugees Fund. This Fund is an innovative public-private effort, in conjunction with the City of Falls Church, to provide rental assistance for 12-18 months for refugee families resettling in the City of Falls Church, making rent more affordable and easing their transition to life in the United States. <strong>Need</strong>: $70,000</p>
    <p><a href="/initiatives/literacy-center">Adult and Family Literacy Center</a></p>
    <p>Launched in spring 2022, the Adult &amp; Family Literacy Center is focused on helping immigrants and refugees gain the literacy and language skills they need to thrive in our community. Children of adult learners can participate in the Children's Literacy Activities Program (CLAP!). Classes are held two nights a week during the fall and spring at Oak Street Elementary School, with the support of Falls Church City Public Schools and in partnership with the English Empowerment Center. <strong>Need</strong>: $24,000, and items from our <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2HTQJ7P9S0QUR">Amazon Wish List</a>.</p>
    <p><a href="/welcoming-week">Community Building Activities</a></p>
    <p>Committed to creating a community of neighbors who are welcoming of immigrants and refugees, Welcoming Falls Church hosts annual events like our Welcoming Week Ice Cream Social and Thanksgiving dinners for recently arrived immigrants and resettled refugees. Intended to raise awareness and foster relationships within our community, these events are free for community members. <strong>Need</strong>: $5000</p>
    <p><strong>Partnership Opportunity</strong></p>
    <p>Welcoming Falls Church seeks a community of 20 major donors to sustain and grow our program offerings. We are looking for partners at these giving levels:</p>
    <p>Diamond (1): $25,000 | Platinum (2): $10,000 | Gold (3): $5000 | Silver (4): $2500 | Bronze (10): $1000</p>
    <p>Checks can be made out to Welcoming Falls Church and mailed to Emily Draper, Treasurer, Welcoming Falls Church, 122 West Greenway Boulevard, Falls Church, VA 22046; or donate online <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=BHV8XLCPHAANS">here</a>.</p>
    {% include paypal_button.html %}
    <p>We are also seeking friends to provide monthly support, whether $25, $50, or $100 a month.</p>
    <p>Thank you!</p>
