    <p><strong>Welcoming Week 2019.</strong> Welcoming Falls Church has historically operated with a very modest budget, but we were humbled by the communityâ€™s willingness to support our work when we asked for help to bring Behold the Dreamers author Imbolo Mbue to Falls Church for Welcoming Week 2019.</p>
